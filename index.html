    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
     I was born on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio, in St. Ann's hospital. It was located at Fairhill and MLK Roads. It burned down some time ago - I don't think I was in any way the cause. It has not existed for decades. I don't know what became of all those records. Before I was born, my parents both emigrated to the United States from Ireland. My brother and I are first-generation Americans. I grew up on the Near West Side of Cleveland (close to, but definitely not in, Ohio City). I graduated from Lincoln-West High School. </p>
     <p>I went to CWRU and earned my first undergrad degree (BA, History) there. My original intent was to go to law school. I like to say I was pre-law, then pre-unemployment, when I graduated in the early 80s. The economy was a little rough in the early 80s - contrary to some revisionist history. Things did get better in the later 80s. Anyway, since I had decided not to go to law school, I got a job in journalism. My second bachelor's is in nursing (from CSU). I worked in various surgical cardiothoracic intensive care units at Cleveland Clinic. I also have a master's in informatics from Thomas Edison State University (NJ). Now here in 2018, I am hoping to learn to code!</p> 
  <p>I have been married for almost 31 years. My husband and I have one child, who is all grown up now. She has just finished nursing school. She also has owned the Pork Chop Shop at the West Side Market since 2012. I am very proud of her. Kids are a lot of fun, at every age. Being a parent isn't always fun, but kids are definitely fun. Enjoy them, they grow up fast! To fill the empty nest, my husband and I currently "parent" a cat named Kitty-Buddy. In our spare time, my husband and I like to go on trail trips where we work with American Hiking Society to work on trails all over the USA. We were just in Washington State in June, I love the Pacific NW.</p>
